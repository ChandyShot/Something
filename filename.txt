Tommorow I have external practical of Communication Skills for Professionals, and Digital Communication Viva.
I am going to fail in Digital Communication Subject because I failed to understand these things. Even in high schools it was my weak area although nothing was my perfect field and that can be understood obviously when you are in pure govt school (not some kv or sarvodaya), we know our teachers by only throught time table that used to circulate among us.
